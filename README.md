# BubbleDodge

You don't want to wash, your aim is to avoid soap bubbles falling out.

Bubble dodge is not complete for the moment !
Currently, only character movement is implemented (with some slight problems).

You need to have pygame installed on your computer

And then you can launch the game:

    python3 ./game.py

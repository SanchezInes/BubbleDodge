# BubbleDodge

You don't want to wash, your aim is to avoid soap bubbles falling out.

Bubble dodge is not complete for the moment !
Currently, only character movement is implemented (with some slight problems).

If you don't have pygame on your computer, you need to run it on an environment by marking this line on your terminal:
  source my-venv/bin/activate
And then you can laucnh the game:
  ./game.py
